Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category.
Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
Assuming the two mentioned constructor methods are built as following:

public DVD(String title) {
    super();
	this.title = title;
}

and

public DVD(String category) {
    super();
	this.category = category;
}

This WILL RAISE AN ERROR because the compiler only takes into consideration the parameter list or 'signature' (in this case, only String),
and ignores the variable name (title and category). So, the compiler would have no way to know whether 'new DVD("ABC")' is meant to
call the title constructor for a movie titled 'ABC' or the category constructor for a movie in the 'ABC' category.

However, multiple constructors in one class is still possible if the parameter lists distinguish from each other.
This is already done in my DigitalVideosDics.java, where I have 4 different constructors.
